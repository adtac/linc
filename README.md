**LINC** is an interpreted programming language that supports data types, arithmetic, conditions, iterations, functions, arrays, console IO, file IO, and exceptions. It is designed with simplicity in mind, without compromising on performance.

LINC stands for `LINC is not C++`. Ironically, it is written in C++.
