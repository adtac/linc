## LINC

LINC stands for "LINC Is Not C++".

It is an interpreted language that borrows syntax and functionalities from C, C++, Python and a few others.

LINC is written purely in C/C++ (ironically).

Features:
	Console I/O
	Integers, strings, characters variables
	Conditional programming
	Loops
	User-defined parametrized functions and recursion
